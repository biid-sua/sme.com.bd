<p>The online market linkage portal is a service which is aimed at promoting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise business.  In order to do this, the portal will facilitate rural businesses e.g. artisans, traditional craftsmen and other such business activities by linking them with potential buyers of such products.  The portal also promotes MSME business by providing information and advisory services such as banking advice, such as how to set up and operate a business, how to  access finance, sourcing and input information, technology information, market information, networking abilities and other essential information for MSMEs such as business licensing, registration, tax information, trade license, etc.  Businesses will be able to access this portal through telecenters (like GP Community Information Centers, Rural Information Centre, etc.) or from any internet enabled access point.</p>
<p>With this aim of promoting MSME business, we are launching the service with a new brand "SHIKOR" with the "Made in CHT" label for products from Chittagong Hill Tracts region.  In the future, this will be expanded to include products from other regions which will be promoted under their own label, such as "Made in Jessore", "Made in Dhaka", "Made in Rajshahi", and obviously "Made in Bangladesh", etc.</p>
<p>BIID already signed MoU with Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) and JCI Bangladesh to promote the portal and facilitate services to the MSMEs.</p>
<p>The service will be promoted through the wider network of telecentres / information centres established all over the countries through partnership with Bangladesh Telecentre Network (BTN).</p>
